# Sales_Analysis
The data set contains features of different items as well as the different outlet shops 
the task is to predict the Sales of a particular item in a particular outlet.
I used various Data Visulisation techniques to find about relavant features .
Guess the most difficult part was this took a lot of time , still not satisfied.
